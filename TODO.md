# TODO

* Flesh out correcting
  * Should be able to move a cell to another beat (so as long as it doesn't
    collide with another)
  * Should be able to remove a cell entirely if it is one beat or something
* Show a history of everything that has been generated in a mini-view on the
  right-hand side (kind of like in Sublime) -- does this mean that every time we
  build a sequence we save it even if no action has been taken?
* Remove ability to move cursor, that isn't needed
* Vary number of beats in a sequence (multiples of 2 between 2 and 32)
* Expand actions to three possible choices:
  - downvote entire sequence
  - upvote entire sequence
  - conditionally upvote (make changes)
* Add button to skip current sequence without saving it - the sequence will
  still get stored but just as downvoted?
* Introduce the idea of "measures" (beat groupings) and display them visually?
